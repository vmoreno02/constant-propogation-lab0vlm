# Part 1: Constant Folding

For this part of the project, you will implement [constant folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding) for a subset of Java and use black-box testing to test its functional correctness. Your implementation will modify and add code contained in the `edu.byu.cs329.constantfolding` package. The implementation will use the [org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom](https://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2Fpackage-summary.html) to represent and manipulate Java. The documentation for the DOM dependencies exists at the [Eclipse website](https://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2Fpackage-summary.html) and at the [IBM website here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wdfrhcw/1.3.0?topic=reference-orgeclipsejdtcoredom). The [constant folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding) itself should be accomplished with a specialized [ASTVisitor](https://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2Fpackage-summary.html). The program will take two arguments as input:

  1. the Java file on which to do constant folding; and
  2. an output file to write the result.

The program should only apply to a limited subset of Java defined below. It should fold any and all constants as much as possible. It should not implement **constant propagation** which is the topic of the final part of this project.

The part of the program that does the actual folding should be specified and tested via black-box testing. A significant part of the grade is dedicated to the test framework and the tests (more so than the actual implementation), so be sure to spend time accordingly. In the end, the test framework and supporting tests are more interesting than the actual constant folding in regards to the grade.

## Reading

The [DOM-Visitor lecture](https://bitbucket.org/byucs329/byu-cs-329-lecture-notes/src/master/DOM-Visitor/) is a must read before starting this assignment. You will also need the [DOMViewer](https://github.com/byu-cs329/DOMViewer.git) installed and working to view the AST for any given input file. Alternatively, there is an [ASTView plugin](https://www.eclipse.org/jdt/ui/astview/) for Eclipse available on the Eclipse Market Place that works really well. There is something similar for IntelliJ too.

## What is Constant Folding?

[Constant folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding) is the process where constant expressions are reduced by the compiler before generating code.

Examples:

  * `x = 3 + 7` becomes `x = 10`
  * `x = 3 + (7 + 4)` becomes `x = 14`
  * `x = y + (7 + 4)` becomes `x = y + 11`

Not that constant folding does not include replacing variables that reduce to constants.

```java
x = 3 + 7;
y = x;
```

Constant folding for the above gives:

```java
x = 10;
y = x;
```

Constant folding may also apply to Boolean values.

```java
if (3 > 4) {
  x = 5;
} else {
  x = 10;
}
```

Should reduce to

```java
if (false) {
  x = 5;
} else {
  x = 10;
}
```

Which should reduce to

```java
x = 10;
```

In the above example, the constant folding removed **dead code** that was not reachable on any input.

Normally, the braces would not be removed automatically. Since the implementation is more difficult that is necessary, we implemented it in the [BlockFolding](src/main/java/edu/byu/cs329/constantfolding/BlockFolding.java) class.

## Block Folding

Consider the following code.

```java
int name(int i) {
  i = 10;
  if (true) {
     i = 20;
  } 
}
```

Constant folding for the if-statement will reduce it to the following:

```java
int name(int i) {
  i = 10;
  {
    i = 20;
  } 
}
```

For the purpose of this project, a folding option to constant folding that reduces nested blocks is needed for constant propagation to work correctly. Since variable **shadowing is not allowed** in the Java subset for this class, folding nested blocks does not cause scoping issues. Block folding inspects every statement in a block, and if a statement in a block is itself a block, then all the statements in that nested block are lifted up to be part of the current block as in the following:

```java
int name(int i) {
  i = 10;
  i = 20; 
}
```

[BlockFolding.java](BlockFolding.java) in this repository is an implementation of block folding that may be used freely to remove nested blocks. As a fair warning, it is provided *as is* with no guarantee of correctness; although, there are no known defects at this point in time.

## Advanced Folding (Optional)

Be aware that [short circuit evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation) comes into play for constant folding. For example ```a.f() && false``` cannot be reduced to ```false``` because it is not known if the call to ```a.f()``` side effects on the state of the class, so it's call must be preserved. That said, ```a.y() && false && b.y()``` can be reduced to ```a.y() && false``` since the call to ```b.y()``` will never take place. As another example, consider ```a.y() || b.y() || true || c.y()```. Here the call to ```c.y()``` will never take place so the expression reduces to ```a.y() || b.y() || true```.

It is also possible to remove literals that have no effect on the expression. For example ```a.y() && true``` reduces to ```a.y()```. Similarly, ```a.y() || false || b.y()``` reduces to ```a.y() || b.y()```. Always be aware of [short circuit evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation) in constant folding since method calls can side-effect on the state of the class, those calls must be preserved as shown in the examples above.

Here is another example of short circuit evaluation that requires some careful thought.

```java
if (a.f() || true) {
  x = 10;
}
```

This code could reduce to

```java
a.f();
if (true) {
  x = 10;
}
```

Which would then reduce to

```java
a.f();
x = 10;
```

That said however, the following example cannot reduce in the same way because if the call to ```a.y()``` returns true, then ```b.y()``` is never called.

```java
if (a.f() || b.y() || true) {
  x = 10;
}
```

It could reduce to

```java
if (a.f() || b.y()) {
   ;
}
if (true) {
  x = 10;
}
```

Which would then reduce to

```java
if (!a.f()) {
  b.y();
}
x = 10;
```

If you implement short-circuiting of two parameters with appropriate tests, notify the instructor to receive extra credit.

## Java Subset

This course is only going to consider a very narrow [subset of Java](https://bitbucket.org/byucs329/byu-cs-329-lecture-notes/src/master/java-subset/java-subset.md) as considering all of Java is way beyond the scope and intent of this course (e.g., it would be a nightmare). The [subset of Java](https://bitbucket.org/byucs329/byu-cs-329-lecture-notes/src/master/java-subset/java-subset.md) effectively reduces to single-file programs with all the interesting language features (e.g., generics, lambdas, anonymous classes, etc.) removed. **As a general rule**, if something seems unusually hard or has an unusually large number of cases to deal with, then it probably is excluded from the [subset of Java](https://bitbucket.org/byucs329/byu-cs-329-lecture-notes/src/master/java-subset/java-subset.md) or should be excluded, so stop and ask before spending a lot of time on it.

## Required Folding

Constant folding is **only required** for the following types of `ASTNode` expressions and statements:

  * `ParenthesizedExpression` that contain only a literal of any type (given as part of the base code)
  * Logical not `PrefixExpression`, `!`, when applied to `BooleanLiteral`
  * Numeric `InfixExpression` for `+` if and only if all the operands are of type `NumberLiteral` including the extended operands
  * Binary relational `InfixExpression`, `<`, if and only if both operands are of type `NumberLiteral`
  * `IfStatement` if and only if the predicate is a `BooleanLiteral`

Assume that any `NumberLiteral` instance is of type `int` always. This set of expressions and statements are much more narrow than what is allowed in the Java subset. That is OK. Folding is only applied to the above program features. Also, folding should be applied iteratively until no further reduction is possible.

## Assignment Requirements

For each required application of constant folding:

  0. Write a specification
  1. Write black-box tests that coincide with the specification
  2. Implement the folding in its own class that implements `Folding`
  3. Add the new folding technique to `ConstantFolding.fold`

After each required application of constant folding is implemented, write some system tests, integration tests, for `ConstantFolding.fold` where all the different folding techniques are enabled to be sure they work together as expected.

As a note, there should not be much more than 25 to 45 tests total (e.g., around 4 to 7 tests for each type of folding and one system test for `ConstantFolding.fold`) as black-box test is very functional. Excess tests will degrade your score for this assignment.

**Warning**: tests should only test one thing, so do not include all the boundary value cases in a single test. Each case should be a different test.

### Suggested order of attack

Approach this assignment in small steps starting with the easiest type, `PrefixExpression`, as it is similar to the `ParenthesizedExpressions` implementation that is given.

   1. Read and understand everything related to `ParenthesizedExpression`
   2. Write the specification for `PrefixExpression`
   3. Create the tests from the specification
   4. Be familiar with the [JDT DOM JavaDocs](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wdfrhcw/1.3.0?topic=reference-orgeclipsejdtcoredom) that documents the ASTNode, its subclasses (like `PrefixExpression`), and their methods
   5. Implement the actual visitor

Repeat for the other ways to fold. It is **important** that the **implementation is created after the specification and tests.** Specification. Then tests. And finally the implementation.
